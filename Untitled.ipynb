This algorithm is commonly used in text classification and spam detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling missing values in Bernoulli Naive Bayes can be straightforward because it assumes that features are binary, meaning they are either present (1) or absent (0). When you encounter a missing value for a feature, you can treat it as if the feature is absent (0) and continue with the classification process. This assumption aligns with the binary nature of the Bernoulli distribution.\n",

    "Testing/Classification Phase:\n",

    "When classifying a new data point with missing values, the algorithm applies Bayes' theorem to compute the probability of the data point belonging to each class.\n",
